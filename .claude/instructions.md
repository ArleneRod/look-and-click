# Claude Code Instructions

## Git Commit Messages

- **DO NOT** include "generated by claude" or any AI attribution in commit messages
- Write clear, concise commit messages that describe what changed and why
- Use conventional commit format when appropriate (feat:, fix:, docs:, etc.)
- Keep the first line under 72 characters
- Focus on the "what" and "why" rather than the "how"

## Branch Naming Convention

- **USE** `feature/*` prefix for feature branches
- **DO NOT** use `claude/*` prefix for branches
- Branch names should be descriptive and use kebab-case
- Examples:
  - `feature/add-config-support`
  - `feature/update-commit-messages`
  - `feature/improve-documentation`

## Development Workflow

1. Create branches with `feature/` prefix
2. Commit changes with clear, attribution-free messages
3. Push to the feature branch when ready
4. Follow standard git best practices
